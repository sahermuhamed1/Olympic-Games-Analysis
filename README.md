**Olympic Games Analysis using SQL + Power BI**

This project addresses another businees problem In this context, I see myself as a data analyst employed at a news company. The task involves visualizing data to help readers comprehend how countries have historically performed in the Summer Olympic Games. 📈🥇
To resolve this business problem, I followed several steps:-
♦️ *Imported the dataset into SQL Server*
♦️ *Analyzed and cleaned the data using SQL queries*
♦️ *Connected Power BI to the SQL server*
♦️ *Uploaded the final dataset to Power BI*
♦️ *Typed my DAX calculations*
♦️ *Visualized the data, presenting information on the number of competitors and medals, sports, gender of the competitors, etc.*
♦️ *Ensured that the visualization is readable for stakeholders and readers*
While I believe this project is not overly complex, it offers a wealth of valuable information and establishes a solid foundation for readers and stakeholders interested in the Olympic games. 🙌
